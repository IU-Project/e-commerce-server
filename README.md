# Overview

This repository is an E-Commerce API used as my `Principle of Database Management` and `Web Application Development` projects at International University (HCMIU). In order to not waste time on system design, I decided to make it based on [Shopee](https://shopee.vn/). Because of API's simplicity, only some of Shopee basic features are covered in the project.

# Detail

## Database Design

I just referred to Shopee's workflows and assumed that the tables below are used in their system, so the design may not be the same as theirs.

## API Documentaion

Read [here](https://tpo-project.github.io/e-commerce-api/).

# Setup

## Clone repo
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:tpo-project/e-commerce-api.git
```

### Run with Docker Compose

> Install Docker & Docker Compose

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Then fill in:
- `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` to connect database.
- `MAIL_` to make emailing functions work.
- `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID` and `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET` if you want users to be able sign in with Facebook (the same with Google and Github).

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up -d

$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml exec api php artisan key:generate

$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml exec api php artisan migrate --seed
```

Access `https://127.0.0.1/api/v2` or `https://localhost/api/v2` to interact with the API endpoints.

### Run with minikube
